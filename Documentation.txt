Documenting: 
J.R. (6/13/2024): Ken, Erika and I have finally met and working on the hackathon project! 
We discuss what we are going for with this project. Our focus is having a chatbot into MARTA (Atlanta's well-trended transportation). We shared stories
about MARTA's biggest issue and that is confusion. Confusion of time, what happened, what line to take, etc. We want our chatbot to communicate with 
consumers and give solutions to those problems. We have brainstormed and now into development phase.
